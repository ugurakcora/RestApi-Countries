![Nexum the REST Countries API challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. We do not expect perfection in them.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful you can share the URL for your project.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Do not forget to stick to a methodology while doing this, `OOCSS` or `BEM` etc.
5. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
6. We do not recommend using any framework, but you are free to use it if you want or see it necessary.
7. If you use gulp or a compiler, don't forget to share the uncompiled version with us.

## Sharing your solution


Share your **#finished projects** solution page in the zip, url, or git link of the [human resources.](mailto:contact.hr@nexum.com.tr)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
